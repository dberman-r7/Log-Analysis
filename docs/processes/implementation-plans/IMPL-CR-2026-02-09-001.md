# Implementation Plan: IMPL-CR-2026-02-09-001

**Related CR**: [CR-2026-02-09-001](/docs/processes/change-requests/CR-2026-02-09-001.md)  
**Plan Version**: 1.1  
**Created**: 2026-02-09  
**Last Updated**: 2026-02-10 09:52:47 UTC

---

## Overview

**Objective**: Update governance framework documentation to explicitly require that CR, IA, and Implementation Plan artifacts be saved as persistent markdown files in the repository, not just in PR descriptions or agent session memory.

**CR Summary**: The current documentation implies but doesn't mandate file persistence. This implementation adds explicit, emphatic language requiring file creation and provides warnings against anti-patterns.

**Complexity**: Low (documentation-only changes)  
**Estimated Duration**: 75 minutes

---

## Prerequisites

**Before Starting Implementation**:
- [x] CR approved and ATP token received ("Go Ahead" provided)
- [x] Branch created: copilot/update-documentation-requirements
- [x] Development environment setup
- [x] Required tools installed: git, text editor
- [x] Dependencies updated: N/A (documentation only)
- [x] Test data prepared: N/A

**Environment Setup Commands**:
```bash
cd /home/runner/work/Log-Analysis/Log-Analysis
git checkout copilot/update-documentation-requirements
git pull origin copilot/update-documentation-requirements
```

  - Phase 3: Implementation Plan - Lines ~503-680

**Expected Outcome**:
- [x] All sections requiring updates identified
- [x] Line numbers documented for precise editing

---

### Phase 2: Implementation

#### Step 2.1: Update copilot-instructions.md - Step 1 (CR Creation)
**Goal**: Add explicit file creation requirement for CR

**File**: `/home/runner/work/Log-Analysis/Log-Analysis/.github/copilot-instructions.md`

**Exact Changes**:
Replace lines 30-33 with:
```markdown
#### Step 1: Generate a Change Request (CR)

> **🚨 CRITICAL: FILE CREATION MANDATORY**  
> The CR document MUST be created as a physical file in the repository at `/docs/processes/change-requests/CR-[ID].md`.  
> **DO NOT** simply document the CR in a PR description or keep it only in the agent session.  
> **This is a required, persistent artifact** that must be committed to the repository.

1. **Assign a Unique CR ID**: Format: `CR-YYYY-MM-DD-XXX` (e.g., `CR-2026-02-09-001`)
2. **Create the CR File** at `/docs/processes/change-requests/CR-[ID].md` using the template
3. **CR Contents Must Include**:
```

**Commands to Execute**:
```bash
# Use edit tool to make the change
# Verify change was applied correctly
grep -A 10 "Step 1: Generate a Change Request" /home/runner/work/Log-Analysis/Log-Analysis/.github/copilot-instructions.md
```

**Expected Outcome**:
- [x] CRITICAL callout added to Step 1
- [x] File creation emphasized as mandatory
- [x] Anti-pattern (PR-only) explicitly forbidden

---

#### Step 2.2: Update copilot-instructions.md - Step 2 (IA)
**Goal**: Emphasize IA must be in CR file (NOT separate)

**File**: `/home/runner/work/Log-Analysis/Log-Analysis/.github/copilot-instructions.md`

**Exact Changes**:
Replace Step 2 header with:
```markdown
#### Step 2: Perform an Impact Assessment (IA)

> **📝 MANDATORY: IA MUST BE SAVED IN CR FILE**  
> The Impact Assessment is NOT a separate document or ephemeral analysis.  
> It MUST be included as a section within the CR file created in Step 1.  
> All IA analysis must be persisted in the repository, not just in PR descriptions or agent memory.

Analyze the **Blast Radius** of the proposed change and **document it in the CR file**:
```

**Expected Outcome**:
- [x] IA requirement clarified (part of CR file)
- [x] Ephemeral analysis explicitly forbidden

---

#### Step 2.3: Update copilot-instructions.md - Step 3 (Implementation Plan)
**Goal**: NEW REQUIREMENT - Emphasize Implementation Plan must be SEPARATE file with detailed instructions

**File**: `/home/runner/work/Log-Analysis/Log-Analysis/.github/copilot-instructions.md`

**Exact Changes**:
Replace Step 3 header with:
```markdown
#### Step 3: Draft an Implementation Plan

> **📋 MANDATORY: PLAN MUST BE SAVED AS SEPARATE FILE**  
> The Implementation Plan is a SEPARATE, detailed instruction document for agent execution.  
> It MUST be saved at `/docs/processes/implementation-plans/IMPL-[CR-ID].md`  
> The plan must contain very detailed, step-by-step instructions that an agent can follow.  
> Plans must NOT exist only in PR descriptions or agent memory - they are permanent artifacts.

Create a **detailed implementation plan file** that includes:
```

And update the file list item 4 to add detail:
```markdown
4. **Files to Modify**: Complete list with rationale
5. **Detailed Agent Instructions**: Very specific commands, file paths, and procedures
```

**Expected Outcome**:
- [x] Implementation Plan specified as SEPARATE file
- [x] File path clearly specified
- [x] Detail requirement emphasized

---

#### Step 2.4: Update copilot-instructions.md - Add Warning Section
**Goal**: Add comprehensive anti-pattern warnings

**File**: `/home/runner/work/Log-Analysis/Log-Analysis/.github/copilot-instructions.md`

**Location**: After Step 3, before Step 4

**Exact Changes**:
Add new section:
```markdown
> **⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING: ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID**  
> 
> **DO NOT**:
> - ❌ Create CR/IA only in PR descriptions (they disappear when PR is merged)
> - ❌ Create Implementation Plans only in PR descriptions or session memory
> - ❌ Keep CR/IA/Plans only in agent session memory (lost when session ends)
> - ❌ Document planning in comments or chat messages only
> - ❌ Skip file creation and rely on verbal/text communication only
> 
> **ALWAYS**:
> - ✅ Create CR file at `/docs/processes/change-requests/CR-[ID].md` (with IA embedded)
> - ✅ Create separate Implementation Plan at `/docs/processes/implementation-plans/IMPL-[CR-ID].md`
> - ✅ Commit both files to the repository before implementation begins
> - ✅ Make Implementation Plans detailed enough for an agent to execute independently
> - ✅ Link to both files from PR descriptions (don't duplicate, just link)
> - ✅ Treat both CR and Plan files as permanent, versioned artifacts
```

**Expected Outcome**:
- [x] Clear DO NOT list added
- [x] Clear ALWAYS list added
- [x] Both files (CR and Plan) referenced

---

#### Step 2.5: Update change-management.md - Phase 1
**Goal**: Add file creation requirements to CR creation phase

**File**: `/home/runner/work/Log-Analysis/Log-Analysis/docs/processes/change-management.md`

**Exact Changes**:
Replace "## Phase 1: Change Request (CR) Creation" section header with:
```markdown
## Phase 1: Change Request (CR) Creation

> **🚨 CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: FILE CREATION IS MANDATORY**
> 
> The CR document is NOT optional and is NOT just a PR description.  
> You MUST create a physical markdown file in the repository before proceeding.
> 
> **Required Actions**:
> 1. ✅ Create file at `/docs/processes/change-requests/CR-[ID].md`
> 2. ✅ Use the complete template provided below
> 3. ✅ Include CR and Impact Assessment in this file
> 4. ✅ Create SEPARATE Implementation Plan file (see Phase 3)
> 5. ✅ Commit both files to the repository
> 6. ✅ Link between files and from PR descriptions
> 
> **Forbidden Actions**:
> - ❌ Creating CR only in PR description
> - ❌ Keeping CR only in agent session memory
> - ❌ Skipping file creation
> - ❌ Creating incomplete CR files
```

**Expected Outcome**:
- [x] Critical requirement callout added
- [x] Required and forbidden actions listed
- [x] Separate Implementation Plan mentioned

---

#### Step 2.6: Update change-management.md - CR Document Structure
**Goal**: Clarify CR contains CR + IA (not Plan)

**File**: `/home/runner/work/Log-Analysis/Log-Analysis/docs/processes/change-management.md`

**Exact Changes**:
Update "### CR Document Structure" with:
```markdown
### CR Document Structure

> **📝 IMPORTANT: This is the CR template (IA included)**
> 
> Create a new file at: `/docs/processes/change-requests/CR-[ID].md`  
> This file MUST contain TWO sections:
> 1. Change Request (CR) - Basic information and description
> 2. Impact Assessment (IA) - Blast radius analysis
> 
> The Implementation Plan is a SEPARATE file (see Phase 3 below).

Create a new file: `/docs/processes/change-requests/CR-[ID].md`
```

**Expected Outcome**:
- [x] Two sections specified (CR + IA)
- [x] Implementation Plan separation clarified

---

#### Step 2.7: Update change-management.md - Phase 3 (Implementation Plan)
**Goal**: Add comprehensive guidance for creating separate, detailed implementation plans

**File**: `/home/runner/work/Log-Analysis/Log-Analysis/docs/processes/change-management.md`

**Exact Changes**:
Replace "## Phase 3: Implementation Plan" section with:
```markdown
## Phase 3: Implementation Plan

> **🚨 CRITICAL: SEPARATE FILE FOR IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**
> 
> Implementation Plans are SEPARATE from CR documents and require their own file.
> 
> **Required Actions**:
> 1. ✅ Create file at `/docs/processes/implementation-plans/IMPL-[CR-ID].md`
> 2. ✅ Use the complete template provided below
> 3. ✅ Make instructions VERY DETAILED for agent execution
> 4. ✅ Include specific commands, file paths, and exact procedures
> 5. ✅ Commit this file to the repository
> 6. ✅ Link from the CR file (add "Implementation Plan: /docs/processes/implementation-plans/IMPL-[CR-ID].md")
> 
> **Forbidden Actions**:
> - ❌ Embedding plan in CR file (keep separate)
> - ❌ Creating plan only in PR description
> - ❌ Keeping plan only in session memory
> - ❌ Creating vague or high-level plans (must be detailed)

Create a detailed, step-by-step plan for implementation as a separate file.

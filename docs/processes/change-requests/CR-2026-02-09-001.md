## Description

### Problem Statement

The current governance framework documentation (`.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `docs/processes/change-management.md`) instructs agents to create Change Requests (CRs), Impact Assessments (IAs), and Implementation Plans. However, it is not sufficiently explicit that these documents MUST be saved as actual markdown files in the repository, not just presented in PR descriptions or kept in agent session memory.

This ambiguity could lead to:
- Loss of important planning artifacts when agent sessions end
- Incomplete audit trail for decision-making
- Difficulty in tracking and referencing past changes
- Violation of the "Docs are Code" principle

### Proposed Solution

Update the governance framework documentation to explicitly and emphatically state that:

1. **Change Requests** must be saved as files in `/docs/processes/change-requests/CR-[ID].md`
2. **Impact Assessments** must be included in the CR file (not separate or ephemeral)
3. **Implementation Plans** must be included in the CR file (not separate or ephemeral)
4. These are NOT optional - they are mandatory saved artifacts
5. Add emphasis that these documents should NOT be created only in PR descriptions or agent sessions
6. Add clear instructions that documents should be created BEFORE implementation begins

### Business Justification

**Value Provided**:
- **Audit Trail**: Complete record of all changes and their rationale
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Future developers can understand why decisions were made
- **Process Compliance**: Ensures governance framework is actually followed
- **Traceability**: Links from code changes back to planning documents
- **Quality Assurance**: Forces proper planning before implementation

**Alignment with Core Principles**:
- "Docs are Code": Documentation must be versioned and persistent
- "No Ghost Code": Every change must have a documented justification
- "Fail Loudly": Make it obvious when process is not followed

### Alternatives Considered

**Alternative 1**: Keep current wording, rely on examples
- **Rejected**: Too easy to misinterpret or overlook

**Alternative 2**: Make CR/IA/Plan files optional
- **Rejected**: Defeats the purpose of governance framework

**Alternative 3**: Create separate files for CR, IA, and Plan
- **Rejected**: Too many files, harder to maintain. Better to keep all in one CR file.

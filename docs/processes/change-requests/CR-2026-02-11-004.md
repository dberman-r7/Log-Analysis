## Title
Improve pagination/polling progress observability for Rapid7 Log Search fetch

## Requestor

## Date

## Category
OBSERVABILITY

## Priority
P2-MEDIUM

## Description
Current runtime output is noisy and makes it hard to tell whether the ingestion pipeline is making forward progress through Log Search polling and pagination (pages/Next links).

This change adds explicit, structured, INFO-level progress events that clearly indicate:
- which Log Search page we’re on,
- how many events were returned per page,
- whether a Next page exists,
- and how long each page/poll cycle took.

The goal is to make it easy to answer “are we working our way through responses?” from CLI logs alone.

### Proposed new/updated log events (non-exhaustive)
- `logsearch_fetch_start` (INFO): introduces a `fetch_id` correlation id for the entire fetch.
- `logsearch_page_complete` (INFO): emitted after each page is collected.
- `logsearch_fetch_complete` (INFO): emitted at the end with totals.

All events MUST be structured JSON and must not log secrets.

## Business Justification
Operators need fast, unambiguous confirmation that the pipeline is progressing and not stuck when running against large time windows. Clear progress logs reduce time-to-diagnosis, prevent premature cancellation, and improve confidence in production runs.

## Affected Components
- `/src/log_ingestion/api_client.py` (pagination + polling logging)
- `/src/log_ingestion/service.py` (top-level fetch timing log)
- `/tests/` (new unit tests verifying progress events)
- `/docs/requirements/rtm.md` (add/update atomic NFR-OBS requirement and traceability)
- `/docs/runbooks/log-ingestion-service.md` (document which events indicate healthy progress)

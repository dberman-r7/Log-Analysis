# Change Request: CR-2026-02-11-006

## Title
Log per-page max event timestamp during Rapid7 pagination

## Requestor
User (dberman)

## Date
2026-02-11

## Category
FEATURE (Observability)

## Priority
P2-MEDIUM

## Description
Enhance Rapid7 Log Search pagination progress logs to include the maximum event timestamp observed in each completed page. This helps operators determine whether ingestion is progressing through the dataset (time-ordered) and reduces ambiguity when long-running jobs appear “stuck”.

## Business Justification
Current logs provide page number, event counts, and latency, but don’t indicate where we are in the dataset’s timeline. Logging the per-page max timestamp provides a low-cost, high-signal indicator for progress and debugging.

## Affected Components
- `src/log_ingestion/api_client.py` (pagination progress logging in `Rapid7ApiClient.fetch_logs()`)
- `tests/test_api_client_progress_observability.py` (assert fields are emitted)
- `docs/requirements/rtm.md` (add an observability requirement)
- (Optional) `docs/runbooks/log-ingestion-service.md` operator guidance

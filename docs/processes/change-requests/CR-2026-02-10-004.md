# CR-2026-02-10-004: Update runbook with IntelliJ IDEA execution instructions

**Requestor**: User
**Date**: 2026-02-10
**Category**: DOCUMENTATION
**Priority**: P2-MEDIUM

## Description
Update the runbook to include instructions for running the main ingestion CLI and available utilities from IntelliJ IDEA (Run Configurations), aligned with the current API client behavior.

## Business Justification
Developers and operators need a reliable, IDE-friendly way to run the service and helper utilities without shell-specific issues. This reduces onboarding time and prevents configuration drift.

## Affected Components
- `docs/runbooks/log-ingestion-service.md`

## Notes
This CR is documentation-only and is intended to keep docs in sync with the current CLI and utilities.
